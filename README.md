# PulseTrack

**PulseTrack** is a lightweight monitoring and logging dashboard designed to simulate real-world event tracking in a web application.  
It showcases a modern stack including:

- **PHP 8.2** with [Fat-Free Framework](https://fatfreeframework.com/)
- **MariaDB** for relational data storage
- **RabbitMQ** for message queuing
- **SolR** for search indexing
- **ELK Stack** for log management
- **Ember Octane** for the frontend
- **Docker Compose** for easy local deployment

## 💡 Purpose

This project was created as a technical showcase to demonstrate hands-on experience with the stack mentioned above, as part of a personal upskilling initiative. It simulates real-time event flows, API interactions, and full-stack integration.
